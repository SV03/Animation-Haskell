# Animation-Haskell

The aim of this project was to produce an interesting animation for Functional Programming IN3043 using the Animation.hs library provided by the university. 

The primary project requirements:
    The submission must not be a static picture; i.e. it must vary over time.
    The picture should feature a group of similar elements, e.g.
        - a collection of similar shapes in different sizes, positions and/or orientations,
        - a polygon with many vertices,
        - a succession of similar shapes over time.
This repetition should be coded concisely using at least one of the following features of Haskell covered up to week 5: list comprehensions and higher-order functions from the Data.List library.
